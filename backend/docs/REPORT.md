When I received the email with the project instructions, I felt an inner strength within me. I have known Diego, Miguel, and To√±ete for two years now and have been a great fan of the Symmetry Challenge, as I, too, am a big fan of programming since discovering it last year at university (studying Mathematics at UCM in Madrid). Therefore, when they posted the application form to work with them, I didn't hesitate to apply. For all these reasons, I wanted to thank you for sending me the instructions; it is an honor for me. 

However, I am a 20-year-old with many responsibilities and when I saw the seven-day countdown I had already confirmed various commitments for that week. Symmetry is now my priority, so I postponed all the commitments I could. Even so, I had to work in the evenings (from 17:00 to 00:30) on the 12th, 14th, and 17th, so I didn't have as much time as I would have liked to solve some issues in my proyect. Nonetheless, this motivated me to organize myself even more, and for these seven days I have been programming non-stop. Interestingly, I am not tired and time has flown by. I am sure it is because, during these seven days, I have been doing what I love with a very motivating goal: to work as a programmer in a very promising company like Symmetry.

This project has been a significant challenge for me. Before receiving the email, I had focused on numerical programming, becoming well-versed in software such as Python, RStudio, and MATLAB. However, I was unfamiliar with the tools required to develop an application. To learn about them, I completed the recommended tutorials in the instructions and further researched on my own through other YouTube channels and by leveraging artificial intelligence (ChatGPT-4) to understand this new language. My learning model involved drawing inspiration from various YouTube tutorials, copying the relevant code snippets, and modifying those that could be useful, ensuring I understood their functionality.

During the development of the application, I overcame many obstacles. One of the main challenges was understanding how to connect my Flutter project with Firebase in a way that allowed articles to be saved in the database. Another significant challenge was learning about BLoCs and cubits and how to implement them successfully (I believe this is one of the strongest aspects of my project). I resolved these challenges through YouTube, the internet, ChatGPT, logic, and time. However, there is one obstacle I have not overcome.

I have not been able to get my application to run. I did not conduct enough testing during the development process, which is my fault, and I ultimately realized that the app does not run. I have spent many hours searching on YouTube, forums, and using ChatGPT to identify the error, but despite numerous attempts, I have not been able to solve it. The strange thing is that none of the files in my project show any apparent errors, and I have not been able to identify the reason why it won't start. I have concluded that there must be a minor directory or similar issue that I haven't been able to pinpoint (I am writing this just minutes before the deadline). In the past, due to my perfectionism, this would have driven me crazy, and I would never have forviden myself to make such an error in an opportunity like this. Therefore, this will be my greatest learning experience: accepting that there is an error in my project and feeling proud of it anyway because I know I have given 100% of my effort and time during these 7 days of the trial. For all these reasons, I understand if this error prevents you from hiring me, but I would still like to thank you for this great challenge and this valuable learning experience.

In conclusion, I wanted to thank the entire Symmetry team for this incredible opportunity to learn from the best resources and to carry out an ambitious project with step-by-step guidance. This project has brought out the best in me, and as a result, I have been able to create a project with a clean architecture, files filled with valuable commands that interact through various hierarchies, striking and useful widgets, and many other elements that you will be able to evaluate in my project. For all these reasons, thank you, Symmetry, and I look forward to your response.
